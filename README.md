# QuantiTanti
This is an app for tracking and managing your daily costs. When adding new cost, you get to pick a cost date, description, amount, choose a category, and optionaly assign a tag or an image of cost.

On welcome screen you have two tabs: 
  1)total daily costs. From there you can add another one, long press for delete the whole day, or click on particular
day and review individual expenses of that day.
  2)all costs listed. Here you have options to search all costs by cost description, or filter through them by categories or tags. Here you can again swipe (or long press) for delete, click on "add new" button or click on existing cost and make some updates.

Not much more to say, hope you 'll like it!
