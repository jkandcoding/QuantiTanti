# QuantiTanti
This is an app for tracking and managing your daily costs. App is very simple, you just need to pick a date, 
choose a category, write a short description, insert a value and that 's it!

On welcome screen you have total daily costs. From there you can add another one, swipe and delete the whole day, or click on particular
day and review individual expenses.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute. This is my first app as a developer, there is a few more things I wanted to do, stuff to add but
currently I'm pausing to work on another project. 
I would love to here your opinion, though.

## Acknowledgments
